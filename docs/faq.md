# FAQ

## Do I need an API key or an account?

No other key and no account. The reviewer is Claude Code or Codex, on your own login and plan. OpenQodex itself calls no model. Without Claude Code or Codex, there is no full review. The GitHub Action is the exception: its review needs an Anthropic API key.

## Does OpenQodex send my code anywhere?

Not through the built-in scanners. Their network use is listed in `security`: scanner downloads, Semgrep rule packs, dependency names and versions sent to osv.dev, Kubernetes schemas and the RustSec advisory database. The reviewer sends the brief and the files it reads to the model of your Claude Code or Codex login. A custom scanner you approved does whatever its own command does.

## Will it block my push?

Not by default. Without `review.block_on_severity` in `.openqodex/config.yaml`, OpenQodex only warns. Set that key to block pushes at a severity. `OPENQODEX_SKIP=1` lets one push through.

## Why did a scanner not run?

The report lists every selected scanner with a status and a reason. The usual reasons:

- The change holds no file it reads. brakeman reads only a file in a Rails app: a folder whose `Gemfile` or `Gemfile.lock` names rails and that holds `config/application.rb` or `bin/rails`.
- It is still downloading on first use. It joins the next run.
- It needs Ruby or Go, which OpenQodex does not install.
- The agent's sandbox cannot download it. Run `npx openqodex doctor --install` in your own terminal, inside the repository.

## Why is a finding missing that the scanner reports on my whole repo?

OpenQodex keeps only findings on the lines your change adds or edits. Findings elsewhere belong to code you did not touch. A finding the agent places outside the changed lines is listed separately and never counts toward the verdict.

## Why were findings in my test fixtures dropped?

Scanner findings in fixtures, mocks, stubs, fakes and snapshots are dropped by default, because those files hold throwaway data. Set `review.include_fixtures: true` to keep them.

## How do I leave files out of the review?

List globs under `review.paths.exclude`. A `**/` prefix does not match a file at the repository root. To match both, list `**/x` and `x`. `config` has the rules.

## Can I use a scanner that is not built in?

Yes, when it is compatible: it writes SARIF or one JSON document. You or your agent add it to `.openqodex/config.yaml` by its GitHub link. Then you approve it with `openqodex trust`. `custom-scanners` explains how.

## Does it change my repository?

The review writes only inside `.openqodex/`. Its `.gitignore` keeps the reports out of git, so the first run adds only `config.yaml`, `custom-instructions.md` and that `.gitignore` to `git status`; they are meant to be committed. The built-in scanners run with fixes switched off, and their caches live outside the repository. A custom scanner you approved does whatever its own command does. `init` in user scope adds the rule files it writes in the repository to `.git/info/exclude`.

## Where are the reports?

In `.openqodex/reviews/<time>-<id>/` in the repository: `report.html` to open in a browser, `report.md` to read as text, `report.json` and `report.sarif` for tools. A review prints the absolute paths of `report.html` and `report.md` when it ends. `.openqodex/latest.json` points at the newest one.

## Does it work on Windows?

Through WSL. OpenQodex runs on macOS and Linux.

## How do I remove it?

`npx openqodex init --uninstall` removes what `init` wrote. Delete `~/.openqodex/` to remove the scanners as well.

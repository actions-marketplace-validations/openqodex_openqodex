# not build unless every built-in scanner is installed at its pinned version
# and reports its check case. Three linux/amd64 builds of image/Dockerfile:
#   full      must build, run as a user other than root, and report every
#             built-in ready when checked again in the finished image;
#   no-ruby   (WITH_RUBY=0) must fail, naming brakeman and rubocop, no other;
#   no-rust   (WITH_RUST=0) must fail, naming cargo-deny, no other.
# The full image is kept as $IMAGE_TAG for local runs.
#
# Needs docker that builds linux/amd64. Without it the check prints the reason
# and exits 0 as skipped; with REQUIRE_DOCKER=1 (the workflow) it exits 1.
# Each build's log goes to $OUT (default: a new temporary folder).

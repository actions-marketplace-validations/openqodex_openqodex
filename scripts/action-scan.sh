# pasted into the script:
#   OPENQODEX_VERSION   the openqodex version to run
#   BASE_SHA            the pull request's base commit, empty outside one
#   BASE_REF            the pull request's base branch, empty outside one
#   PUSH_BEFORE         a push event's previous commit (all zeros for a new ref)
#   DEFAULT_BRANCH      the repository's default branch
#   BLOCK_ON_SEVERITY   empty, or a severity name
#   CONFIG_FROM         base or head
#   EVENT_NAME          the event that started the workflow
#   REVIEW              auto, off or required
#   CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION the Claude Code version the review runs
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY   the repository's key, set on the step from a secret
#   RUNNER_TEMP, GITHUB_OUTPUT, GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY   set by the runner
# The key leaves the environment on the first line below. Only the review
# command gets it back: doctor, the Claude Code install and a fallback scan
# never see it, and nothing here prints it or writes it to a file.
# The script's own helpers (od, tee, mktemp, sed and the rest) come from the
# system folders only. git, node, npx, npm and claude, and the runtimes the
# scanners use, come from the workflow's PATH only when the file and every
# link on the way to it lie outside the repository; the script runs them by
# their resolved paths, and its programs get a PATH of links to those files
# plus the system folders, never the workflow's PATH.
# The output of every program goes to the job log with workflow commands
# off, so text from the pull request (a file name) cannot write one.
# The scanner install, the review and the scan run under one tool-failure
# policy: a failure sets status tool-failed and warns; the next step decides
# whether that fails the job.

// Which program the scanner install starts as its worker, from a throwaway
// script that imports the resolver the way a debug script would. These tests
// import the built package (dist) and start the built CLI: run `pnpm build`
// first. The first one downloads actionlint from GitHub into a fresh home.
//
// Ways it could fail, written before the code (issue #69):
// 1. The worker is the running script (process.argv[1]) started again, so a
//    script that imports the resolver starts itself, and each copy starts
//    another, without end.
// 2. One install starts more than one worker.
// 3. The worker is not the openqodex bin with its __install argument.
// 4. A process that is itself an install worker (the marker in its
//    environment) starts another worker.
// 5. A script names its own file as the install program, and the resolver
//    starts it or the install body runs in it (found by the review of the
//    first fix: the program was a name any caller could set).
// 6. The install body runs in a program other than the openqodex bin, such
//    as a script that imports it and calls it, instead of stopping with one
//    line.
// 7. A process that may not start an install also stops waiting on one that
//    another process already runs (init-review.test.ts, case 12, guards it).
//
// Every run here is capped: the throwaway script ends at once on its fourth
// start, the watcher kills every worker past the third and fails the test,
// and the script itself is killed after 80 seconds.

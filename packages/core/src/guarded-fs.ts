// The one way OpenQodex changes a file it does not own outright: every
// write, rename and delete is decided by filesystem identity and done
// through checked handles. init and the commands around it, the update
// worker, the home receipts and the repository's .openqodex files write no
// other way (packages/cli/test/guarded-writes.test.ts checks).
//
// Deciding. A path is walked the way the system walks it: one name at a
// time from the root, each name looked up without following it, a link
// followed where it stands, `.` and `..` taken after the links before them.
// Every folder reached is known by its device and inode, never by how it
// was spelled, so case, Unicode normalisation and different spellings of
// one folder stop mattering. Then:
// - a link whose own folder lies, by identity, in the repository's work
//   tree, and not in a git folder that itself lies inside the work tree, is
//   refused: the repository decides where it points (agents/git.ts
//   inWorkTree draws the same line). A link anywhere else is the
//   developer's own (a dotfiles repo links ~/.claude/settings.json) and is
//   followed;
// - the folder the path lands in must lie, by identity, under one of the
//   folders init may write (each opened once, when the guard is made).
//
// Doing. A write opens the verified folder (O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW) and
// keeps the handle, creates its temp file with O_CREAT | O_EXCL | O_NOFOLLOW,
// writes, fsyncs and renames it into place. Node has no renameat(2), so the
// rename goes by path; the closing check is that, after it, the final path
// holds the very file written (same device and inode as the open handle) in
// the very folder verified. On any mismatch it removes what it can and
// fails. A delete never follows a link, and checks the identity of the
// folder before each name it removes inside it.
//
// Reading. FolderReader reads under a root known by identity: every read
// walks from that root down one name at a time, each name a real folder
// (lstat: a link is not one), opens the file without following a link,
// then walks again and requires the same folders, by device and inode, and
// the opened file at its name. A link put on the way before the open, or
// put there and taken away again around it, fails one of those checks.

// Ways the diff parser could fail:
// 1. A C-quoted header path (non-ASCII, quote, backslash) is kept with its
//    quotes and escapes, so the path names no real file.
// 2. An unquoted path is altered.
// 3. An added source line that starts with "++" is read as a "+++" file
//    header, sending later coverage to a path built from source text.
// 4. A deleted file gets coverage.
// 5. In a zero-context diff, deleted lines advance the new-side counter, so
//    the wrong lines count as changed.
// 6. A second hunk in the same file keeps the first hunk's counter.
// 7. A file name ending in a space loses the space (git ends such a header
//    path with a tab).

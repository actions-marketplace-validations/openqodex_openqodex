// Ways the push gate could fail, written before the code:
// 1. It ever returns "allow".
// 2. With no block_on_severity it denies, or stays silent about an
//    unreviewed change.
// 3. It treats a review of an earlier version of the change as a review of
//    this change.
// 4. With block_on_severity set it lets a blocked or missing review through
//    without denying, or denies a passing review of this change.
// 5. Its message does not say what to run.
// 6. A review judged with no threshold, or another one, passes a push after
//    block_on_severity is set (the config is outside the change id).
// 7. An incomplete record blocks a push, even with block_on_severity set.
// 8. A legacy receipt (the old two-step protocol) counts as a complete
//    record, or suddenly blocks a push the old version let through.
// 9. A complete passing review of this change is not silent.
// 10. A blocked or incomplete review names its report by a path relative to
//     the repository, which nobody can click, or names report.md where
//     report.html exists; or a receipt written before report.html existed no
//     longer gives its message.
// 11. A blocked push tells the agent to fix everything, where the developer
//     chooses what to fix.

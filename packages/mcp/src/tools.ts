// The MCP tools: one per question of the graph's query layer, plus
// `graph_refresh` (PLAN.md 3.3, "MCP tools"). One tool per question, because
// an agent picks a tool by its description; no generic query tool, no file
// reading, no search over text: the agent has its own reads, and every
// answer here carries evidence and a floor.
//
// Each tool turns its arguments into the one Request shape of the query
// layer, with the same target parser the command line uses, so the tool and
// `openqodex graph <question> --json` give the same answer for one build.

// The correctness corpus (packages/graph/corpus, PLAN.md 3.6): each case is a
// real two-commit repository, built in a temp folder and reviewed through
// getChange, buildGraph and detectImpact, then scored against its
// expected.json. One test per case, named for the real failure it guards;
// a case the graph fails today is marked `knownFailure` in its expected.json
// and runs as `it.fails`, so fixing the graph turns it red until the marker
// goes. The last test holds the gate: certain precision, evidence validity,
// gap disclosure, cut disclosure, recall and the negative controls all 1.
// The framework plugins' cases (corpus/frameworks/) run in
// frameworks-corpus.test.ts, one group per plugin, with the same gate.

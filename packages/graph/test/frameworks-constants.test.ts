// The constants a plugin's fact reader looks up while it keeps the strings
// of a file are found from one index per file. Way it could fail, written
// before the code: each concatenation's constant scans every fact of the
// file again, so a file under the size cap that repeats `P + "/" + S`
// thousands of times after thousands of other assignments costs the square
// of its facts before any cap applies. The check: a file four times as large
// takes about four times the CPU time to read, never about sixteen.

// The one depth-first pass over a parse tree: the core extractor's
// (extract.ts) and the framework plugins' fact readers' at once. Each used
// to walk the tree with its own cursor, and on a JavaScript repository the
// walks cost more than the readers' own work. Here the cursor moves once,
// each node's type is read once, and its field name and its ancestors are
// read once and handed to every reader. A node object is made only for a
// node whose type the core or a reader asked for, or that a reader reads as
// an ancestor: making one for every named node cost more than the readers'
// own work too.
//
// Ways it could fail, written before the code (shared-walk.test.ts):
// 1. A reader sees other nodes, or the same nodes in another order, than
//    its own walk showed it, so its facts change.
// 2. A reader that skips a node's children hides them from the others.
// 3. A reader that throws loses the facts of the others, or keeps being
//    called and throws again on every node.
// 4. A reader is told it left a node at another point than its own walk
//    told it, so a scope or a frame it keeps closes at the wrong node.
// 5. The core extractor sees other nodes than its own walk showed it, or
//    a reader riding on its walk sees other nodes than it sees alone: the
//    core skips the children of a node the readers still read (an import,
//    a type alias), and walks into a region the parser could not read,
//    which the readers never enter.
// 6. A reader that names its types is entered for another node, or not
//    for one of its types, or reads an ancestor the walk did not make as
//    null or as another node.
//
// The walk keeps no step back up the parents: a node's ancestors come from
// the path it keeps as it enters and leaves nodes, never from a node's
// `parent`, which tree-sitter finds by descending from the root again (a
// lookup per node would make a deeply nested file quadratic). The one
// exception is an ancestor a reader reads through `up` that the walk did
// not make (a type the reader did not name in `keep`): it is found from
// the nearest node made below it, once, and kept on the path.

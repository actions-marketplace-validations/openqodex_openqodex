// A glob match in time linear in the path for each part of the pattern:
// the repository writes these globs (workspace member lists, tsconfig
// include and exclude), so a pattern with many stars must not backtrack.
// The meaning is core's matchesGlob: `*` is any run without a slash, `**`
// any run at all, `?` one character that is not a slash, anything else
// itself; anchored at both ends.
//
// The match walks the pattern once, keeping the set of path positions the
// pattern so far can end at: O(pattern parts * path length), never more.

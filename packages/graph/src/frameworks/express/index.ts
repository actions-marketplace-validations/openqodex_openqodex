// The Express plugin (PLAN.md 3.2.3, the Express row): applications made by
// `express()`, routers made by `express.Router()` or `Router()`, the routes
// registered on them with `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`,
// `options`, `head`, `all` and `route(...)`, the routers and middleware
// added with `use`, composed under their mount paths into the full
// pattern each application serves, and the supertest requests that may
// reach each route. See resolve.ts for the rules.

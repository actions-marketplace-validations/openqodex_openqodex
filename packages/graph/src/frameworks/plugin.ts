// The framework plugin interface (PLAN.md 3.2.3). A framework plugin turns a
// framework's own conventions into graph facts with proof: route
// registrations and their handlers, models and fields, migrations,
// templates, components, hooks, jobs, commands, signals, config keys and the
// links from tests to code. The core never names a framework; every
// framework rule lives in one plugin folder (`frameworks/<id>/`), and a
// plugin runs only from the shipped registry (`frameworks/registry.ts`):
// repository code is never loaded as a plugin, and nothing from the
// repository is executed.
//
// A plugin works in two steps, kept apart like the rest of the graph:
//
// 1. `facts`: context-free facts from one file's parse tree, cached with the
//    file's language facts under the file's content and the plugin's
//    version. A fact never refers to another file, never names the file's
//    own path, and is plain JSON.
// 2. `detect` and `resolve`: after symbol resolution, with every file's
//    facts and the resolved graph, read through `PluginIndex` only. This is
//    where a registration is bound to its handler, a template name to a
//    file and a test request to a route. It runs on every build, so a file
//    whose content did not change is re-read when a framework is newly
//    detected around it (no stale plugin output).
//
// Rules every plugin obeys (PLAN.md 3.2.3, the protected choice on
// registrations):
// - API identity: a registration counts only when its receiver or callee
//   binds to the framework's own import (`from django.urls import path`),
//   or the file has the framework's role (`config/routes.rb` inside a
//   `routes.draw` block). A dependency in a manifest enables a rule; it
//   never proves a receiver.
// - Application scope: every entity carries the application it belongs to.
//   Two applications in one repository never merge their routes.
// - Literal evidence only: a route path, template name, config key or job
//   name that is computed becomes an unknown with cause "dynamic", never an
//   edge.
// - Registrations are kept apart from handlers: a registration whose
//   handler is missing, computed or outside the repository is still listed,
//   with the handler's status and an unknown that says why.
// - A static test association is a reference, a call or a possible request;
//   it is never called coverage.
// - Overflow is a gap: every cap emits a scoped unknown when it stops.
// - Failure removes output: a plugin that throws contributes nothing to the
//   build, and the build says so.
//
// This file is the contract other plugins build against. It only grows:
// a field or a union member is appended, never removed or narrowed, and a
// change bumps PLUGIN_API_VERSION.

// The FastAPI plugin (PLAN.md 3.2.3, the FastAPI row): applications made by
// `FastAPI()`, routers made by `APIRouter()`, the routes registered on them
// with decorators (`@app.get`, `@router.post`, `api_route`, `websocket`)
// and with `add_api_route`, the routers included with `include_router`
// composed under their prefixes into the full pattern each application
// serves, the dependencies that run before each handler (`Depends` and
// `Security`), the classes that are Pydantic models, pytest tests, and the
// test client requests that may reach each route. See resolve.ts for the
// rules.

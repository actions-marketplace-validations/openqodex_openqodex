// Opening a graph for questions: one way for the command line and the MCP
// server, so the two never answer from different builds of one tree.
//
// A pin captures the work tree, builds or reuses the graph in the owning
// repository's `.openqodex/graph/`, and holds the build it got with a lease,
// so no collection removes it while questions are answered from it (PLAN.md
// 3.2.7). A pin of a kept build (`--generation`) never builds. Each pin
// keeps the graph input digest of what it read (build.ts, captureDigest):
// every eligible file's content, and every manifest, lockfile, workspace
// file and followed config with its content or its absence. A later
// question computes the digest of the work tree again, with no parse, and
// says that files changed since (`laterEditsKnown`) when the two differ.
